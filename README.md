# Bank Web App

## Overview
Bankist Web App is a personal project developed to simulate basic banking operations such as account management, transfers, deposits, and loan requests. This project was created with the help
        of the JavaScript course by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Users can log in using their predefined usernames and passwords.
- **Account Summary:** Users can view their account details, including current balance, transaction history, and loan status.
- **Transfers and Deposits:** Users can transfer funds to other accounts by specifying the recipient's username and the amount. They can also make deposits to their own accounts.
